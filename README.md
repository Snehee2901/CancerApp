# Cancer Prediction App

## This app can be used to predict the type of the cancerous cell from the uploaded image.

This project is dedicated to developing an innovative and user-friendly application for predicting cancerous cells using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Early and accurate cancer detection can significantly improve patient outcomes, and this app aims to assist healthcare professionals in their diagnostic processes.

## Key Features

- Predict cancerous cells from medical images.
- User-friendly web interface.
- Support for both lung and colon cancer prediction.
- Easy integration with medical imaging systems.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Backend development and machine learning model implementation.
- **Streamlit:** Frontend development and web app deployment.
- **PyTorch:** Deep learning framework for building and training machine learning models.
